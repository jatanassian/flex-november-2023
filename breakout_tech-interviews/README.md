## Approaching a whiteboard question

- Any format: whiteboard, paper, notepad, jamboard...
- Important part is how you solve the problem, not the syntax
- Interviewer wants to look at the logic, your thoughts process
- Remain calm, take the time to read/think and understand the question
- Read the prompt, even out loud
- Ask questions: show your curiosity
- Write down the steps
- Talk out loud while you code

- Identify inputs: what information, where does it come from
- Indentify outputs: what is the end result
- Processing: how do we get from to input to output
  - Break things down, step by step
  - Write comments
